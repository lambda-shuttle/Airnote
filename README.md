## _ðŸ“¦ ARCHIVED_ â€” Airnote

### ðŸ‘‰ Update

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Further development on this project has __ceased__; well, unless the forks say otherwise. Please note that most, if not all, of the code in this repository was written in the _"hackathon rush"_. Thus, the codebase does not adhere to well-known industry practices and/or standards - it's quite messy (as expected for short-term rapid prototyping). Also, the GCP project associated with this repository has been terminated. Please __do not__ consider this codebase as an example of representative work from any of the contributors. ðŸ˜€

Airnote was an augmented reality iOS app that aimed to create a collaborative, spatial note-taking experience via sticky notes whose contents were transcribed through Deepgram's speech-to-text API. This app was developed in collaboration with [Xuan (Tom) Zhao](https://github.com/zhao-xuan), [Boyue (Peter) Zhang](https://github.com/mbyzhang), and [Shuntian Liu](https://github.com/Vincent-lau) as a submission for Hack Cambridge Atlas 2022.
